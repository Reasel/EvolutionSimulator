These are my general notes of the project:


What I want is to have the ability to set some starting conditions like:
Number of creatures
Obstacles with frequency and size
number of herbivores to start and carnivores.
Making the walls of the arena solid or just passthrough like old asteroid games.



The creatures themselves would be circles and would have vision in a cone in whatever direction they faced.
Some sort of eye on the circle and placement would determine the cone of vision or moreover the opposite.
I would also like to color them in such a way that at a glance you can tell what 'build' they are.
Such as herbivore, carnivore, and omnivore. Maybe even scavenger.

I want to introduce stat lines of 'skills' like you would have in an RPG where when an offspring is generated
it will spend some 'points' into its tree. It will only spend up to a certain number equal to where it has information 
on the success of that point from the parents. So that the inital creatures are not using all their 'points'.
Thus it will take a few generations for all creatures to use all their points. With some randomness in when
children branch from tradtion and take a new skill or something completely unlike their parents.


Would like the ability to fast forward simulation by skipping rendering the game and instead focus on progressing game-ticks
faster. Preferably on a slider to do in real time. As well as pausing.


Would like to be able to click on a given creature and see its stats as well as its lineage. Such as clicking on its parents and being able
to inspect that parent.

Some sort of logging of all known creatures as well as their position/lifespan. This would allow for record of a simulation and the ability to playback
a simulation again after the fact. Would like to be able to rewind given this information.

Ability to delete creatures from an edit menu. That or change fundamental stats/brain parts.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the creatures are simple finite machines of decisions that do not alter their own brains during their lifetime then the execution would be the exact
same given the starting conditions and creatures. This is only true for the starting creatures. So to save the execution you would simply need to log 
everything about a creature as well as its offspring so that on a 'replay' of an execution when two creatures decide to make a child you can have them
look at the log too see if they have done so in the 'previous execution' and if so copy that exact creature and go from there. Thus removing the random
generation of the new offspring. When the playback reaches the end of the known log then it simply continues execution using traditional random generation.
This playback would be temporarily logged under a new log such that during this new playback you could make changes in the middle of the playback and have it continue.
